    Project Objectives;
    #1 Popular times of travel
    - most common month
    - most common day of week
    - most common hour of day
    #2 Popular stations and trip
    - most common start station
    - most common end station
    -most common trip from start to end
    #3 Trip duration
    - total travel time
    - average travel time
    #4 User info
    - counts of each user type
    - counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
    -earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
    Datasets:
    Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities.
    All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
    - Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
    - End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
    - Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
    - Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
    - End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
    - User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
    The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
    - Gender
    - Birth Year
